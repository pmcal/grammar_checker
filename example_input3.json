Suddenly, a loud noise come from the door and the cat jump off the mat quickly. The birds outside on the tree sings loudly, they don’t seem to be bother by the noise. In the kitchen, my mom cooking dinner and my dad were reading the newspaper. I asks my brother where is the TV remote at, but he didnt knew. Everyone in the house seem calm, but the cat still looked nervous from the sudden sound. I decided to go for a walk outside, hoping it will clear up my head and help me relaxed."
